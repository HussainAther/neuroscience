A passive neural membrane is a shift-invariant linear system. According to Eq. 8, the membrane
potential fluctuations (above and below E) may be predicted by convolving the injected current
with a low-pass filter. The parameters of that low-pass filter, g and C, completely determine the
behavior of the membrane.
