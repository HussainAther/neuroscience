In states of nonequilibrium the Nernst potential (V_n) doesn't need to equal the actual
potential jump across a membrane. The flux of ions through a membrane will be dissipative and
proportional to a net driving force.

Ohmic conductance hypothesis dictates:
j_qi = z_ie*j_i = (deltaV - V_n) * g_i

in which j_i is the number of ions of type i per area per time crossing the membrane,
j_qi is the electric charge flux, z_ie is the charge on one ion, and g_i is the constant
of proportionality of conductance per area.
