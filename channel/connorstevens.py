"""
The Hodgkin-Huxley (HH Hodking Huxley hodgking huxley) model was developed on the basis of 
data from the giant squid axon. The Connor-Stevens model provides an alternate description 
of action-potential general using fast Na+, delayed rectifier K+, and leakage 
conductances (as the HH model does), but the Na+ and K+ conductances have properties 
somewhat different. The C-S model also has an extra K+ conductance (known as the A-current) that is transient.
