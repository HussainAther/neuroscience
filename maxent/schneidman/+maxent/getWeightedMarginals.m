% Returns the marginals of a ME model for a set of samples weighted by a set of probabilities
%
% Usage:
%   marginals = getWeightedMarginals(samples,model, probabilities)
%
%
% The function accepts a model and an array of samples and returns the empirical average of the model's moment
% functions over the set of samples.
%
% Arguments (mandatory):
%   samples - Set of samples to train the model on, in the format (ncells x nsamples). 
%   model   - Maximum entropy model as returned by trainModel()
%   probabilities - the probability used to reweight each sample
%
% Output:
%   marginals - an (1xnfactors) vector of marginals.
