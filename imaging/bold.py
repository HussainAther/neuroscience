"""
Extracting the average time-series from one signal, time-locked to the occurence of some type of event in 
another signal is a very typical operation in the analysis of time-series from neuroscience experiments. 
Therefore, we have an additional example of this kind of analysis in Auditory processing in grasshoppers

The following example is taken from an fMRI experiment in which a subject was viewing a motion stimulus, 
while fMRI BOLD was recorded. The time-series in this data set were extracted from motion-sensitive voxels 
near area MT (a region containing motion-sensitive cells) in this subjectâ€™s brain. 6 different kinds of trials 
could occur in this experiment (designating different directions and locations of motion). The following example 
shows the extraction of the time-dependent responses of the voxels in this region to the different stimuli.
