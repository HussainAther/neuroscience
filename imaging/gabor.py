In image processing, the Gabor filter is a linear filter for texture analysis. 
It detects frequency content in the image in specific directions in a localized
region around the point or region of analysis.

We can investigate the extent to which it's similar to perception of the human visual system
with biologically plausible deep learning techniques.
