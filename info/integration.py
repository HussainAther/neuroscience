"""
Humans use Bayesian optimal integration in the information from both
visual and auditory stimuli at the same tiem and same location in time and space.

Following "Bayesian inference with probabilistic population codes" (2006) by Ma et al.,
we can express the mathematical distribution of subject's estimates of these stimuli.

In a cue combination task, the goal is to integrate two cues, c1 and c2, both of which provide
information about the same stimulus, s. For instance, s could be the spatial location of a stimulus,
c1 could be a visual cue for the location, and c2 could be an auditory cue.
