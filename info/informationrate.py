"""
We can measure the information rate of spike firing using the following method. First, we estimate
the signal from spikes (using the noise-reduction approaches), then we compute noise in the estimated
signal (measuring the random errors and removing them), after that we compute the signal-to-noise-ratio of the
estimated signal, and finally calcualte lower bound to information rate from the signal-to-noise ratio.

# Information provided to us by spike-train
def fanofactor(spiketrains):
    """
    Evaluates the empirical Fano factor F of the spike counts of
    a list of `neo.core.SpikeTrain` objects.

    Given the vector v containing the observed spike counts (one per
    spike train) in the time window [t0, t1], F is defined as:

                        F := var(v)/mean(v).

    The Fano factor is typically computed for spike trains representing the
    activity of the same neuron over different trials. The higher F, the larger
    the cross-trial non-stationarity. In theory for a time-stationary Poisson
    process, F=1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spiketrains : list of neo.SpikeTrain objects, quantity arrays, numpy arrays or lists
        Spike trains for which to compute the Fano factor of spike counts.

    Returns
    -------
    fano : float or nan
        The Fano factor of the spike counts of the input spike trains. If an
        empty list is specified, or if all spike trains are empty, F:=nan.

    """
    Estimates instantaneous firing rate by kernel convolution.

    Parameters
    -----------
    spiketrain : neo.SpikeTrain or list of neo.SpikeTrain objects
        Neo object that contains spike times, the unit of the time stamps
        and t_start and t_stop of the spike train.
    sampling_period : Time Quantity
        Time stamp resolution of the spike times. The same resolution will
        be assumed for the kernel
    kernel : string 'auto' or callable object of :class:`Kernel` from module
        'kernels.py'. Currently implemented kernel forms are rectangular,
        triangular, epanechnikovlike, gaussian, laplacian, exponential,
        and alpha function.
        Example: kernel = kernels.RectangularKernel(sigma=10*ms, invert=False)
        The kernel is used for convolution with the spike train and its
        standard deviation determines the time resolution of the instantaneous
        rate estimation.
        Default: 'auto'. In this case, the optimized kernel width for the
        rate estimation is calculated according to [1] and with this width
        a gaussian kernel is constructed. Automatized calculation of the
        kernel width is not available for other than gaussian kernel shapes.
    cutoff : float
        This factor determines the cutoff of the probability distribution of
        the kernel, i.e., the considered width of the kernel in terms of
        multiples of the standard deviation sigma.
        Default: 5.0
    t_start : Time Quantity (optional)
        Start time of the interval used to compute the firing rate. If None
        assumed equal to spiketrain.t_start
        Default: None
    t_stop : Time Quantity (optional)
        End time of the interval used to compute the firing rate (included).
        If None assumed equal to spiketrain.t_stop
        Default: None
    trim : bool
        if False, the output of the Fast Fourier Transformation being a longer
        vector than the input vector by the size of the kernel is reduced back
        to the original size of the considered time interval of the spiketrain
        using the median of the kernel.
        if True, only the region of the convolved signal is returned, where
        there is complete overlap between kernel and spike train. This is
        achieved by reducing the length of the output of the Fast Fourier
        Transformation by a total of two times the size of the kernel, and
        t_start and t_stop are adjusted.
        Default: False

    Returns
    -------
    rate : neo.AnalogSignal
        Contains the rate estimation in unit hertz (Hz).
        Has a property 'rate.times' which contains the time axis of the rate
        estimate. The unit of this property is the same as the resolution that
        is given via the argument 'sampling_period' to the function.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError:
        If `spiketrain` is not an instance of :class:`SpikeTrain` of Neo.
        If `sampling_period` is not a time quantity.
        If `kernel` is neither instance of :class:`Kernel` or string 'auto'.
        If `cutoff` is neither float nor int.
        If `t_start` and `t_stop` are neither None nor a time quantity.
        If `trim` is not bool.

    ValueError:
        If `sampling_period` is smaller than zero.

    Example
    --------
    kernel = kernels.AlphaKernel(sigma = 0.05*s, invert = True)
    rate = instantaneous_rate(spiketrain, sampling_period = 2*ms, kernel)
