    Bartlett's method (or Bartlett's periodogram) uses (1) an original point N data segments into which we split 
    our data k (input array of spikes) into, with each of length m; (2) compute periodogram using the discrete 
    Fourier transform (DFT) then find the squared magnitude of the result and divide by m; (3) average the
