https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2016.00094
Excellent, very complete review of the ML/cortex frontier. It argues in favour of a computational neuroscience that researches the brain’s cost functions and their optimisation processes, rather than specific circuits. It debates what ML can learn from neuroscience and vice-versa.
