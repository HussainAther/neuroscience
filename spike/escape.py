"""
In the escape noise model, the integrate-and-fire neuron with a threshold (theta) that fires even though the formal
threshold hasn't been reached or may stay quiescent even though the formal threshold has transiently been passed.
We use the "escape rate" or "firing intensity" that depends on the momentary state of the neuron.
This Spike Response Model (SRM) is a type of generalized integrate-and-fire model that we can calculate.
