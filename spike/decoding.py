"""
Estimate static stimulus values on the basis of spike-counting firing rates.
We estimate such a stimulus from the sequence of firing times of the spikes that the stimulus evokes.

If r is the spike-count firing rate of neuron a, we can obtain an estimate of the wind direction
on any given trial from the direction of the vector v_pop.

v_pop = the sum of (r/r_max)*c_a from a=1 to 4.

If we assume each neuron in a popultion fires independently, the firing-rate probability
for the population is the product of the individual probabilities:

    for each nueron. T is the time period. r is the firing rate.

The CramÃ©r-Rao bound sets a limit of the variance of any estimate s_est according to:

(sigma_est)^2 >= (1 + b'_est(s))^2 / I_F(s)

in which b'_est(s) is the derivative of b_est(s), the bias on all stimulus variables. I_F(s) is the
Fisher information, a measure of encoding accuracy. Through this, the Fisher infomration limits the
accuracy with which any decoding scheme can extract an estimate of an encoded quantity.
