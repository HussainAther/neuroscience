"""
In some cases of studying the reliability of neural computation,
we find ourselves at the extremes of what we can compute and determine
about the neural functions themselves. What is the scale of spatial precision?
We know the eye samples the world with a discrete lattice of photoreceptors.
In the human fovea this lattice spacing on the retina corresponds to an angular spacing of ~0.01 
degrees in the visual world.

In an acuity task, we distinguish one point source from two point sources of the 
same total intensity. We look at the intensity pattern on the retina from a single
point source.
