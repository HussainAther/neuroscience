"""
When modeling circuits using cable theory, we assume the segments are cylinders with constant radii.
The electrotonic potential is due to a change in the membrane potential.
At any instant of time, the resting membrane potential (E) can be changed
by several means. We can inject current, use extracellular currents, and
discover changes in membrane conductance caused by driving forces.

As such, the current in the neuron behaves in accordance with mathematical theory.
