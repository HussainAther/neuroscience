%{
A series of experiments first reported in 1942 investigated the threshold of human subjects for 
detecting brief, weak light flashes. The experimental conditions were carefully optimized to maximize 
the sensitivity of human subjects. Prior to the task, the subjects were kept in the dark for at least 
30 mins to ensure full dark-adaptation of their visual system. The flashes were delivered at a horizontal 
distance 20 degrees away from the fovea in a region where the density of rod photoreceptors is high. 

The area covered by the stimulus (10 mins of arc) was also optimized to yield the highest sensitivity. 
Stimuli were presented for 1 ms and the wavelength of the light stimulus was 510 Î¼m, a value at which the 
eye is known to be most sensitive for dim vision (Figure 19.2A). In the experiments, the energy of the 
light flash or equivalently the mean number of photons delivered at the cornea was varied and the 
frequency at which the observers detected the flashes was recorded.

This function plots the results.
