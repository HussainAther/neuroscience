We model Lobula plate tangential cells (LPTC lptc) used in the fly visual ganglia. The lobula plate is
in the posterior part of the lobula complex (the third visual ganglion of the fly eye). We use electrophysiological
recordings to study the large diameter of the intracellular processes. The integrating neurons can be modeled on a 
biophysical level with direct recordings of their membrane properties.
