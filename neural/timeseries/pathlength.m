function Plength = pathlength(A)

% PATHLENGTH Calculate minimum pathlengths for a given adjacency
%           matrix.
%
%   Input   A: n by n adjacency matrix (symmetric).
%
%   Output  Plength: n by n matrix of pathlengths. Element in
%                    position (i,j) is pathlength from node i to node j.
%                    If no path exists, inf is returned.
%
%   Description:    Powers up the adjacency matrix until either there are
%                   no elements equal to zero or the (n-1)st power has been
%                   reached. Records the first power at which (i,j) element
%                   became nonzero.
%
%   Example: Plength = pathlength(A);
