"""
Steady-state (steady state) of a correlation detector for periodic sine gratings
moving at a constant velocity. For sine waves of wavelength lambda (lamd) and contrast
deltaI traveling at velocity v, the inputs are spaced by deltaphi, the temporal filter
has an amplitude and phase response A and phi, respectively.
