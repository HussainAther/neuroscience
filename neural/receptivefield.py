"""
In 1952 Hubel and Wiesel made an interesting discovery. When they inserted thin electrodes into cat's visual cortex and presented small spots of light on a screen in front of the cat, some of the cells responded by firing spikes only when the spot was at a particular positions.
The same cell would be inhibited by spots located in different areas of visual field or it would not respond at all.
The responses of such neurons were fully characterised by the inhibitory and excitatory areas in the visual field. They called such neurons simple cells.

They also found another type of cells that manifested more complex responses. These cells, called complex cells, would respond only to a visual object of a particular shape and orientation no matter where it was positioned in the visual field. If the image was slightly rotated
or its shape was changed, the response was supressed.
